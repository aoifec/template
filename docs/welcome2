#Welcome to Swrve! 

>It’s easy to get started — just follow the 3-step onboarding guide below! Want to see what you can do with Swrve? Check out the Swrve videos. If you want to start experimenting with Swrve right away, then jump right in with the Swrve app.

### 1. Add your App ###

Add your app’s platform titles to the Swrve service and nominate the lead developer responsible for integrating each title. Swrve then emails your developer to prepare them to start the integration process.

###2. Integrate Your App ###
Integrating the core functionality of Swrve into your app is quick and easy. Your nominated lead developer integrates the SDK with just one line of code to enable you to access basic analytics and Swrve’s in-app messaging functionality. After that, there’s just a few additional steps to complete the core integration — then it’s up to you just how sophisticated you get using Swrve’s advanced integration options.

###3. Engage Your Users###
Start using Swrve to track what your app users are doing, learn from their behavior, build personalized relationships with them, and engage with them in a relevant, meaningful way.
